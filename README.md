# sms-rain-reminder

This application fetches weather data from the open weather map API to check the rain in the next 12 hours, and uses Twilio API to send SMS reminder to take an umbrella . 
It's quite a fun app to build and have ☔️ 

Still needs a nice UI, change reminder time from the front-end 

#### I might be adding more to it later...
